Gor GA:

- plot how the individuals are evolving --> 5 panels from the paper
- plot the "best member" and the "median member"
- compute the mean value of the iterations for a given population to reach
the optimum point. Do it also for MCMC by ploting the conv ratio vs the length of the chain
- Mention in the report the problem I had when changing to strings to do the crossover and mutations

Notes:

I won't compute the average length it took for a chain to converge, because at the beginning I didn't implemented
the annealing function to halt when convergence happened. I did so, to have the same length in all the chains and
use the simplified version of the Gelman and Rubin equations. I can check it inderectly by studying how the convergence
ratio changes as a function of the length of the chain. I'll actually do it

use 6 plots for GA individual approa
add the best fitness score to the plots as a legend obviously
