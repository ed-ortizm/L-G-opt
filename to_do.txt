The code is working. Here the guideline to characterize it
(this is generic and can be used to the other two algorithms):

1. Start from 10 diferent points (10 chains) and save all the data
in a file

2. Use  the Gelman-Rubin diagnostics for the data generated in the
last step: get the convergence ratio

3. Do the last two steps for nn = [1,3,...,21]

4. Plot the convergencce ratio against nn

5. Plot all the data generated in 1 and see how to add 2

questions:

1. I have generated the PSRF and they seem to be very alike when changin'
the lenght of the chains and the nns. Is that Ok? What should I be noticing?

2. What exactly does PSRF measures?. I computed the % of the number of chains
that converged according to my threshold and it changes with nn, but the PSRF no.
