The code is working. Here the guideline to characterize it 
(this is generic and can be used to the other two algorithms):

1. Start from 10 diferent points (10 chains) and save all the data 
in a file

2. Use  the Gelman-Rubin diagnostics for the data generated in the
last step: get the convergence ratio

3. Do the last two steps for nn = [1,3,...,21]

4. Plot the convergencce ratio against nn 

5. Plot all the data generated in 1 and see how to add 2
